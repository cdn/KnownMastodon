 # KnownMastodon

Syndicate your posts to Mastodon instances

- Share Status, Articles, Images & Bookmarks
- Handles content warnings : use || as separator between spoiler text and status. Text will be split there.
- A photo with #nsfw in title will set to sensitive and one has to click to see it in Mastodon.

Admin page shows all Mastodon servers connected by the users.

- Multiple servers possible; something breaks at three (but who needs that much syndication?)

Still on the Todo list:

- Selective deletion of Mastodon accounts.
- Delete instance from server page.

Installation: save and rename KnownMastodon to IdnoPlugins/Mastodon

Activate under Site Configurations—Plugins

Add an account under Account Settings–Mastodon
