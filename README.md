 # KnownMastodon

Syndicate to Mastodon

Work in progress.

What's working:
Status from Known to Mastodon is working. Still a bit quick&dirty
Admin page shows all Mastodon servers connected by the users.

What's not working yet:
Share other than status.
Add multiple Mastodon accounts.

Installation: save and rename KnownMastodon to IdnoPlugins/Mastodon
